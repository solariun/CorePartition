This is a special demo and was designed for ATMEGA128 or 328 because it uses special features. To run you must have to have a Arduino uno, Duemilanove, Diecimila, Nano ... any one with that processor.

This was designed to demonstrate that this lib is also ready for preemption when the yield is called from a timer.
